    "__Histograms__ are typically the first graphical display of quantitative data, that is, data with a numerical value associated where mathematical operations make sense. Histograms are ok with either discrete or continuous variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Histograms are excellent for a first time data exploration effort. On any histogram, the x-axis shows the interval of possible values for the variable, while the y-axis shows the frequency associated with each value subgroup (called bins)\n",
    "\n",
    "Histograms have the following four features:\n",
    "- Shape: overall appearance. Might be symmetric, skewed to a side, or conforming to a distribution\n",
    "- Center: the mean or the median of the histogram\n",
    "- Spread: how far the data spreads to the extreme values of the variable. The main spread desctriptor is range (max-min)\n",
    "- Outliers: data points that fall far from most other data points\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example, a dataset, when represented on a histogram could be: bell-shaped unimodal, with a mean and median of 50, a range of 20, and no apparent outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bell-shaped distributions are easy to work with in terms of statistics. Unimodal distributions make things even easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not confuse histograms with bar charts. They look similar but are very different. Histograms always look at quantitative data. Bar charts always look at categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a bimodal distribution, there are two values that are of high frequency.\n",
    "Right- or left-skewed distributions have long \"tails\". Those tails are usually determined by outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "The __median__ cuts the data into two groups of equal total frequency. It is a nice robust measure of center\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially when there are big outliers, make sure to indicate the range where the bulk of the data is.\n",
    "\n",

    "On a normal distribution, 68% of values fall within 1 stdev. 95% of values fall within 2 stedvs, and 99.7% of values fall within 3 stdevs. Those values are known as the 68-95-99.7 rule, or the \"empirical rule\"\n",
